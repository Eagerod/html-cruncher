# html-cruncher

HTML-Cruncher is a light-weight, dependency-free package for parsing HTML documents. 
It exposes some methods that are typically found in a browser's console, where the DOM can be searched with `getElementById`, and `getElementsByClassName`.
HTML documents are parsed using the `fromString` method.
